# Testing custom analyzers

In this guide, we will be testing our custom analyzer.

## Pre-requisites

This guide assumes that you are familiar with [writing custom analyzers for DeepSource](writing-analyzers.md).

## Annotations for testing

The test runner requires a file (or a set of files) to be annotated with an appropriate issue code in the form of a comment, with the format `raise: <issue_codes>`.

These files would then be used by the test runner for validating the reports generated by the analyzer.

For example, `staticcheck` raises the following codes at these lines (for the code below):
- `U1000` at line 5
- `SA4017` and `S1039` at line 6

```go
package pkg

import "fmt"

func trigger() {
	fmt.Sprint("trigger")
}
```

The file should then be annotated with the following comments:

```go
package pkg

import "fmt"

func trigger() { // raise: U1000
	fmt.Sprint("trigger") // raise: SA4017, S1039
}
```

A single annotation can contain multiple issue codes. However, the annotation should be in the form of a comment, with the format `raise: <issue_codes>`.

## Writing tests for analyzers

The DeepSource Go SDK provides a easy way to test your analyzers using the built-in test runner. The test runner reads the report generated by the analyzer and validates it with the annotated files.

> **Note**:
>
> Validation is done by reading the annotated issue codes in the files. These issue codes are matched with the reported issues (`analysis_report.json`) - if the issue codes don't match during validation, the test fails.

Here is the flow for testing custom analyzers:

- Run the analyzer (`Run()`)
- Generate the report through the processor (`Processor.Process()`)
- Save the report (`SaveReport()`)
- Use the built-in test runner (`analysistest.Run()`)

The test runner accepts the directory containing the annotated files as an argument.

Here is an example on how to use the built-in test runner for writing tests:

```go
package tests

package analyzers

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/deepsourcelabs/deepsource-go/analyzers/analysistest"
	"github.com/deepsourcelabs/deepsource-go/analyzers/processors"
)

func TestAnalyzer(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("Run staticcheck as DeepSource Analyzer", func(t *testing.T) {
		// set environment variables
		tempDir := t.TempDir()
		t.Setenv("TOOLBOX_PATH", tempDir)
		t.Setenv("REPO_ROOT", tempDir)

		rp := processors.RegexProcessor{
			Pattern: `(?P<filename>.+):(?P<line>\d+):(?P<column>\d+): (?P<message>.+)\((?P<issue_code>\w+)\)`,
		}

		a := &CLIRunner{
			Name:      "staticcheck",
			Command:   "staticcheck",
			Args:      []string{"-f", "text", "./testdata/src/staticcheck/..."},
			Processor: &rp,
		}

		err := a.Run()
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatal(err)
		}

		report, err := a.Processor.Process(a.Stdout())
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatal(err)
		}

		err = a.SaveReport(report)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatal(err)
		}

		err = analysistest.Run("./testdata/src/staticcheck")
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatal(err)
		}
	})
}
```
